# Automated-Watering-System


*Introduction*

This project involves creating an automatic plant watering system using MATLAB, Arduino boards, and sensors. The system is designed to monitor and control the moisture of the plant to ensure optimal growth.

**Objectives**

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the understanding of state machines in creating an automated plant watering system.

Design Analysis

To design the automatic watering system, the following materials were required:

MATLAB on a Mac
MOSFET
Arduino
Water pump
9V batteries
Wires
Water source
Plant

Procedure

The first step in creating the system was to establish a linear relationship between the soil sensor values. This was done by plotting the values on a graph to show when the soil was wet (1) and when it was dry (0). The moisture values were then set as the thresholds for watering the plant.

The state machine was created in MATLAB and uploaded to the Arduino board. The moisture sensor continuously monitored the soil moisture and sent data to the Arduino board. The state machine then determined whether the soil was too dry and activated the water pump to water the plant.

Results

The automated plant watering system was successfully created and was able to measure the moisture of the soil at different times and water the plant when the moisture level fell below a certain value.

Conclusions and Recommendations

Overall, this project was a success as the state machine was effectively used to automate the plant watering process. The project could be further improved by adding additional sensors such as temperature and light sensors to monitor other aspects of plant growth.
